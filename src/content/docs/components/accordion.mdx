version: 1.0.0

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'jo-astro-components';

## Introduction

The Accordion component provides an expandable/collapsible section of content that follows the WAI-ARIA best practices. It uses the native HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for built-in accessibility and functionality.

## When to use

Accordions are perfect for progressive disclosure of content, allowing users to focus on specific information while keeping the interface clean and organized. They're especially useful for:

- FAQ sections
- Content that needs to be shown/hidden
- Settings panels
- Any content that benefits from progressive disclosure

## Quick example

<div class="not-content">
  ``` html live
  <div class="btn btn-primary">Button primary</div>
  <div class="btn btn-secondary">Button secondary</div>
  ```
</div>

<div class="not-content">
  ```astro live
    ---
    import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'jo-astro-components';
    ---

    <Accordion>
      <AccordionItem title="Try me - click to expand" open>
        <p>This is a simple example of the accordion component. Try clicking on the other items below!</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem title="How does it work?">
        <p>The accordion uses native HTML elements for accessibility and adds enhanced styling and behavior.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem title="What about keyboard users?">
        <p>Try using the Tab key to navigate and Enter/Space to toggle items open and closed.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  ```
</div>

## Usage

Learn how to implement the Accordion component in your project, from basic usage to advanced variants.

### Basic

```astro {7, 13}
---
import { Accordion, AccordionItem } from 'jo-astro-components'
---

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem
    name="astro"
    title="What is Astro?"
    open
  >
    <p>Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.</p>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem
    name="astro"
    title="Why Astro?"
  >
    <p>Ship less JavaScript to your users while maintaining a modern developer experience.</p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Exclusive behavior">
  Use the `name` prop to create mutually exclusive accordion groups where only one item can be open at a time. Leave it empty to allow multiple items to be open at the same time.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Initial state">
  Use the `open` prop to set an accordion item's initial state. This is particularly useful for FAQ sections where you want to highlight the most common question.
</Aside>

### Variants

The AccordionItem component offers flexibility in its visual presentation through two distinct styles using the `variant` prop, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your design needs.

```astro ins={10}
<Accordion>
  {/* Default variant with plus/minus icon */}
  <AccordionItem title="Default Style">
    <p>Uses a plus/minus icon on the left</p>
  </AccordionItem>

  {/* Chevron variant with arrow on the right */}
  <AccordionItem
    title="Chevron Style"
    variant="chevron"
  >
    <p>Uses a chevron icon on the right</p>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Props

Configure the Accordion and AccordionItem components using these available props to customize their behavior and appearance.

### Accordion

<div class="props-wrapper">
| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `class` | `string` | `''` | Additional CSS classes to apply to the accordion wrapper |
</div>

### AccordionItem

<div class="props-wrapper">
| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | `''` | Optional group name for exclusive opening behavior |
| `title` | `string` | required | The header text for the accordion item |
| `class` | `string` | `''` | Additional CSS classes to apply to the item |
| `variant` | `'default' \| 'chevron'` | `'default'` | The visual style variant of the accordion item |
| `tagName` | `string` | `'h3'` | HTML tag to use for the title element |
| `open` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the accordion item is initially open |
</div>

## Accessibility

Accessibility isn't an afterthought - it's built into the core of this component through native HTML elements and careful consideration of user interactions. The Accordion component is built with accessibility in mind:

- Uses native HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for built-in accessibility
- Proper heading structure with configurable heading tags (`h2`-`h6`)
- Keyboard navigation support:
  - `Enter` or `Space`: Toggle accordion item
  - `Tab`: Navigate between focusable elements
- ARIA attributes automatically managed by native elements
- Smooth animations with reduced-motion support
- Automatic light/dark mode color adaptation
- Progressive enhancement using modern CSS features

<Aside type="tip" title="User preferences">
  The component automatically respects user preferences for reduced motion and color scheme.
</Aside>

## Styling

Make the Accordion component your own with custom styling while maintaining its accessibility features.

<Aside type="caution" title="Accessibility considerations">
  When applying custom styles, ensure they don't compromise accessibility by regularly testing your changes with manual and automated accessibility audits.
</Aside>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Custom CSS">
    ```css
    /* Option 1: Using :global() in your style block */
    <style>
      :global(.accordion .title) {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
      }

      :global(.accordion .content) {
        padding: 2rem;
      }
    </style>

    /* Option 2: Using is:global on the style tag */
    <style is:global>
      .accordion .title {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
      }

      .accordion .content {
        padding: 2rem;
      }
    </style>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Tailwind Classes">
    ```astro
      <Accordion class="border-2 border-dashed border-yellow-400 rounded-lg p-4">
        <AccordionItem
          title="Styled with Tailwind"
          class="hover:bg-yellow-50 dark:hover:bg-yellow-900"
        >
          Content
        </AccordionItem>
      </Accordion>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="note" title="Style scoping">
  Astro components use scoped styles by default. To override component styles, you'll need to use either `:global()` selectors or the `is:global` directive on your style tag.
</Aside>
